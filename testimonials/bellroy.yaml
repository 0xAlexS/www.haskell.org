  We tried out Shopify and Magento before carving out our own path,
  building out a custom e-commerce platform largely in Ruby on
  Rails. Over the last two years we've changed direction and most of
  our greenfields projects are being written in Haskell as we push
  harder towards a headless e-commerce model. We've found the
  stability, maintainability and performance of Haskell to be
  exceptional and we look forward to more of that in the years to
  come.
