        <p>There are three widely used ways to install the Haskell toolchain on supported
           platforms. These are:
        </p>
        <ul>
           <li>
              <p><a href="#minimal">Minimal installers</a>: Just GHC (the compiler), and build
                 tools (primarily Cabal and Stack) are installed globally on your system, using your
                 system's package manager.
              </p>
           </li>
           <li>
              <p><a href="#stack">Stack</a>: Installs the <code>stack</code> command globally: a project-centric
                 build tool to automatically download and manage Haskell dependencies on a
                 project-by-project basis.
              </p>
           </li>
           <li>
              <p><a href="#platform">Haskell Platform</a>: Installs GHC, Cabal, and some other tools,
                 along with a starter set of libraries in a global location on your system.
              </p>
           </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These options make different choices as to what is installed globally on your
           system and what is maintained in project-specific environments. Global
           installations allow more sharing across users and projects, but at the cost of
           potential conflicts between projects. To avoid these conflicts, each option
           has a lightweight <i>sandboxing</i> feature that creates largely self-contained,
           per-project environments. With Minimal you can optionally sandbox the
           libraries, avoiding most conflicts. Stack sandboxes the compiler, tools and
           libraries, so avoids nearly all kinds of conflicts between projects. With
           Platform you can also optionally sandbox libraries, but not the globally
           installed platform libraries.
        </p>
        <h3>Haskell IDEs &amp; other distributions</h3>
        <p>In addition to the generic, cross-platform Haskell toolchain described above,
           there are also easy-to-use, platform-specific distributions and IDEs.
           The Haskell Wiki contains a <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Distributions">list of the most popular ones</a>.
        </p>
        <!-- For information on other platforms and methods, please see the section on
           [third party installers](#other). -->
        <hr style="height:1px;background-color:black" />
        <h2>Minimal installers</h2>
        <h3>What they are <a name="minimal"></a></h3>
        <p>Minimal installers provide centrally the
           <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc">GHC</a>  compiler and the
           <a href="https://www.haskell.org/cabal/">Cabal</a> and
           <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack">Stack</a> tools for
           installing packages. Some may install further build tools (i.e. for
           parsing and lexing) as well.
        </p>
        <h3>What you get</h3>
        <ul>
           <li>Only the core libraries necessary for each platform are included.</li>
           <li>Cabal or Stack must be used to download and install packages after installation.</li>

        <h2>Stack</h2>
        <h3>What it is <a name="stack"></a></h3>
        <p>Stack is a cross-platform build tool for Haskell that
           handles management of the toolchain (including the GHC compiler and MSYS2 on
           Windows), building and registering libraries, and more.
        </p>
        <h3>What you get</h3>
        <ul>
           <li>Once downloaded, it has the capacity to download and install GHC and other
              core tools.
           </li>
           <li>Project development is isolated within sandboxes, including automatic
              download of the right version of GHC for a given project.
           </li>
           <li>It manages all Haskell-related dependencies, ensuring reproducible builds.</li>
           <li>It fetches from a curated repository of over a thousand packages by default,
              known to be mutually compatible.
           </li>
           <li>It can optionally use Docker to produce standalone deployments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Haskell Platform</h2>
        <h3>What it is</h3>
        <a name="platform"></a>The Haskell Platform is a self-contained, all-in-one
        installer. After download, you will have everything necessary to build Haskell
        programs against a core set of useful libraries. It comes in both minimal versions
        with tools but no libraries outside of GHC core, or full versions, which include a
        broader set of globally installed libraries.

           <li>The <a href="https://www.haskell.org/cabal/">Cabal build system</a>, which can install
              new packages, and by default fetches from
              <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/">Hackage</a>, the central Haskell package
              repository.
           </li>

        <h2>Additional Libraries <a name="libraries"></a></h2>
        <p>In Haskell, packages are configured and built with the Cabal package system built into GHC (and other compilers). For more specific details, see <a href="https://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/">The Cabal User Guide</a>. The command line tools to download and install packages are either <code>cabal</code> or <code>stack</code>, each having different workflows. For details on their usage, see the documentation above.</p>
        <h3>Hackage</h3>
        <p>Hackage is a repository of packages to which anyone can freely upload at any time. The packages are available immediately and documentation will be generated and hosted there. It can be used by cabal install.</p>
        <p>You can install a package using cabal by running:</p>
        <pre>&#36; cabal update
&#36; cabal install the-package</pre>
        <p>Note that if you are not in a sandbox, this will install the package globally, which is often not what you want, so it is recommended to set up sandboxes in your project directory by running <code>cabal sandbox init</code>.</p>
        <p><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/packages/">Go to Hackage &rarr;</a></p>
        <h3>LTS Haskell</h3>
        <p>LTS Haskell is a stackage-based long-term support set of packages which build and pass tests together, with backported bug fixes.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.stackage.org/lts">Get LTS Haskell &rarr;</a></p>
        <h3>Stackage Nightly</h3>
        <p>Stackage is a nightly generated stable repository of snapshots of package sets in which only packages which build and pass tests together are bundled together into a snapshot.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.stackage.org/nightly">Get Stackage Nightly &rarr;</a></p>
        <h3>From source control repositories</h3>
        <p>Installing from a source repository is also possible. For example, to clone and install the network package from source, you would run:</p>
        <pre>&#36; git clone https://github.com/haskell/network
&#36; cabal install network/</pre>
        <p>Or:</p>
        <pre>&#36; git clone https://github.com/haskell/network
&#36; cd network
&#36; cabal install</pre>
