  We're a very small startup (in team size, not in our customer base
  ☺️) based out of Brussels. We use Haskell to power parts of V1 and
  almost all of V2 of our services, and we'd like to do more in the
  near future to help the Haskell community & increase awareness of
  its benefits. Because solving complex problems well require the best
  tools in the business.
