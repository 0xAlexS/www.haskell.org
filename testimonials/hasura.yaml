  Haskell is the ideal programming language for us at Hasura, because
  it can actually be several languages at once. Turning on several of
  the more advanced extensions, we can work with a language that
  allows us to be very precise, asserting a lot about the properties
  of our code at compile time. Or alternatively, Haskell is an ideal
  prototyping tool, when we want to build an MVP and get a prototype
  out as quickly as possible. Even used in this way, Haskell provides
  more guarantees about our code than most other available languages,
  while still enabling rapid development. Haskell lets us be precise
  when we need to be, and fast when we want to be.
