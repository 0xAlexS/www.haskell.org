  We're Bitnomial. Bitnomial is a CFTC-regulated derivatives exchange
  written entirely in Haskell. We use Haskell to implement our
  low-latency matching engine, order entry gateways, pricefeeds,
  settlement systems, and everything else. Haskell gives us huge
  leverage over our complex business domain while allowing us to stay
  nimble and innovate. The type system allows us to integrate new
  knowledge quickly and refactor our sizeable code base with relative
  ease. Our first products will be a physically-settled Bitcoin future
  with options on the future.
